            <p>EarthBound Co. hosts volunteer planting days to help restore green 
                spaces on campus and around Troy to celebrate Earth Day. We work in areas like Washington Park
                 and the Troy University Arboretum, depending on the project. Our next event 
                 will take place at Washington Park on April 22, 2026, at 9:00 a.m. Additional
                  dates for March, April, September, and October will be posted as our schedule 
                  is confirmed.</p>

            <h1 class="about-title">Environmental Awareness Workshop</h1>
            <p>EarthBound Co. will be visiting Charles Henderson Middle School during
                 Earth Week to talk with students about simple, everyday ways to help 
                 the environment. We’ll share tips on recycling, reducing waste, and 
                 taking care of local green spaces. This workshop is scheduled for 
                 Thursday, April 23, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. We are still looking for
                  volunteers as this will be a hands-on workshop for multiple classrooms.
                   We hope to add more outreach days as other schools show interest.</p>

            <h1 class="about-title">Neighborhood Shade Days</h1>
            <p>EarthBound Co. values community and nature, and so we love to give back to both. 
                We organize weekend “Shade Days” in specific neighborhoods 
                where volunteers plant street and yard trees to reduce heat, improve air 
                quality, and beautify streets. Partner with local councils or neighborhood 
                associations to identify high-need blocks and have residents “adopt” nearby 
                trees for watering and basic care.</p>

            <p>Earthbound Co. understands the importance of family. Which is why we offer families 
                and organizations the chance to sponsor trees planted in “Remembrance 
                & Celebration Groves” to honor loved ones, milestone events, or community heroes. 
                Host a short annual ceremony or open day at each grove where people can visit, learn 
                about the species planted, and see the collective impact.</p>
