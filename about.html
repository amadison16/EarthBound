                <p class="about-body" >Earth Bound is a student led initiative dedicated to restoring 
                    balance between people and the planet through reforestation, 
                    environmental education, and sustainability outreach. We believe
                     meaningful change begins locally whether it’s planting trees, 
                     organizing workshops, or collaborating with community partners 
                     to promote greener practices. Every project we take on reflects 
                     our commitment to protecting natural ecosystems, empowering others 
                     to take action, and building a more sustainable future for all.
